## Requirements for running the training script

Trainer.py -> contains the class which we will use for training

**train**.py -> the main script to execute and train a model given a training dataset

existing models inside the folder 'models_and_parameters' are overridden when training script is executed

hyperparameter_space.json contains the exact same hyperparameter space as was used for training Effective T3 Version 3.0

hyperparameter_space_less_strict.json contains a larger collection of initial allowed hyperparameter values to optimize over
