The test protein sequences were obtained by randomly sampling 34 protein sequences
from the cdhit- & psicdhit clustered and further via interproscan processed sequences.

The t3se_negative_test_more.fasta file contains additional protein sequences that
were not used to avoid a too drastic imbalance between positive and negative samples.
