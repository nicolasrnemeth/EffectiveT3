## Information about the organism and definition of each protein sequence in the training and test datasets

the .json files contain the following:
-> keys are the protein identifiers inside the .fasta files
-> values are the organism, i.e. bacterial genus and species as well as definition of each protein

mappings:

- eff_train_pos.json contains information about t3se_positive.fasta
- eff_train_neg.json contains information about t3se_negative.fasta
- eff_test_pos.json contains information about t3se_positive.fasta
- eff_test_neg.json contains information about t3se_negative.fasta
